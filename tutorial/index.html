    <title>CEP WIth Akka and Esper</title>
</head>
<body>

<div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.espertech.com">Esper</a> is a popular open source Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine.
The ideas of CEP are a good fit with the Akka actor model and this code explores these ideas.
It is also described in a series of blog posts on <a href="http://franklysauer.com">franklysauer.com</a>.
The code is all available on <a href="https://github.com/fsauer65/akka-esper-integration">github</a> and you
can use it any way you see fit.</p>
    <p>The next 2 sections explain how Esper can be wrapped up in a few scala traits
        (by no means meant to be a comprehensive scala API to esper!), and the 2 sections after that show
    how you can use those traits to embed esper in either an Akka actor or an akka event bus.</p>

    <p>This is not meant to be an EPL tutorial. For details on EPL please read the
        <a href="http://esper.codehaus.org/esper-4.4.0/doc/reference/en/html_single/#epl_clauses">EPL reference</a>.
    The sample EPL used in this code implements a simple and totally fake trading algorithm.
    It generates a Buy iff the moving average of a given window length is higher than the oldest
    price in that window (in other words, it is trending upwards). To do so, it inserts incoming Price events into two
    streams, a 'Delayer' and an 'Averager'. These two streams are then joined to generate the trades.</p>
    <p>The Price events inserted into the CEP engine are instances of a scala Price case class. This works because its fields
    are annotated with @BeanProperty and it gets registered as an Esper Event type.</p>
</div>
<div><h2>Wrapping Esper</h2>
<p>
    The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/experiments/esperakka/EsperEngine.scala" class="shortcut">EsperEngine</a> trait
encapsulates the bare minimum code required to get a functional esper engine up and running. It is written as a trait
so that it can be used both with an Actor and an Event Bus as shown in the next two sections.</p>
<p>Note that <b>epService</b> and <b>epRuntime</b> are declared lazy. This is needed to ensure they are not instantiated
until after all the event types are registered with the esperConfig. When using this trait it is critical that you register all
the required esper event types BEFORE creating any EPL statements using <b>createEPL</b>.</p>
<p>Creating EPL statements is done with <b>createEPL</b> which takes the statement text and a function that is invoked when the statement
fires and produces events. The parameter type to the callback is <b>EsperEvent</b>. Here is an Example: </p><pre><code>
createEPL(s"""
        insert into Averages
        select symbol,avg(price) as price
        from Price.std:groupwin(symbol).win:length_batch($windowSize) group by symbol
        """) { evt => println(s"Got a ${evt.evtType}: ${evt.underlying}")

}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div><h2>Esper Modules</h2>
    <p>In the previous section we saw how to register single EPL statements using <b>createEPL</b>. Esper also supports the concept of modules that
       can contain multiple statements, import other modules, etc. See
        <a href="http://esper.codehaus.org/esper-4.0.0/doc/reference/en/html/packaging_deployment.html#deploy-eplmodule">Esper Module Syntax</a>
        for all the details.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/experiments/esperakka/EsperModule.scala" class="shortcut">EsperModule</a> trait wraps this idea.
    You can mix-in this trait into anything that also mixes in the EsperEngine trait which is enforced by the self type.</p>
    <p>Use <b>installModule</b> to deploy an esper module into the engine. Since a module may contain many EPL statements and we are probably not
    interested in many of the intermediary events being passed from stream to stream, only statements annotated with a <b>@Name</b> annotation will
    get a listener installed on them. The eventType of the resulting EsperEvent is the value of this <b>@Name</b> annotation.
    The following shows an example with a module defined in an embedded string. Modules can also be loaded from various other sources.</p>
    <pre><code>
     installModule(s"""
        module SimpleAverageTrader;

        insert rstream into Delayed
        select rstream symbol,price
        from Price.std:groupwin(symbol).win:length(${windowSize-1});

        insert into Averages
        select symbol,avg(price) as price
        from Price.std:groupwin(symbol).win:length_batch($windowSize) group by symbol;

        @Name("Buy")
        insert into Buy
        select p.symbol, p.price, $orderSize as amount
        from Price.std:unique(symbol) p
        join Delayed.std:unique(symbol) d on d.symbol = p.symbol
        join Averages a unidirectional on a.symbol = p.symbol
        where a.price > d.price;
        """) { evt => // will only get called when the Buy rule fires
           println(s"Got a ${evt.evtType}: ${evt.underlying}")
     }
    </code></pre>
</div>
<div><h2>CEP in an Akka Actor</h2>
    In this section we will explore embedding Esper inside an actor.
    <p>This <a href="#code/src/main/scala/experiments/esperakka/EsperActor.scala" class="shortcut">EsperActor</a>
    will accept messages to register esper event types,
    install EPL statement or entire modules, and finally to start processing events.</p>
    <p>All the messages are defined in the companion object to the esper actor class. On receipt of the StartProcessing message
    the actor uses <b>become</b> to change its behavior so that all subsequent messages are inserted into the now
    initialized and started esper engine.</p>
    <p>The <b>DeployStatement</b> message contains an <b>Option[ActorRef]</b>. This actor ref is used as the receiver for EsperEvent messages
    that are sent when the EPL statement invokes its update listener. If you don't require a callback simply use <b>None</b>.</p>
    <p>The <b>DeployModule</b> message is very similar but it deploys an entire esper module and since those contain multiple statements,
        the listeners are a map that maps event types to actor refs. If you want to send the events produced by a statement with
        annotation @Name("Foo") to actor ref Bar, use <code>Map("Foo"->Bar)</code>.</p>

    The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/experiments/esperakka/EsperActorExample.scala" class="shortcut">EsperActorExample</a> shows
    how to use this actor using individual EPL statements.
    The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/experiments/esperakka/EsperActorModuleExample.scala" class="shortcut">EsperActorModuleExample</a>
    demonstrates the use of the DeployModule message.
    <p>Note that there is a lot of room for improvement here, especially with respect to error handling.
        We should probably use a supervisor to deal with exceptions, especially during the initialization, where we can
    encounter bad EPL or unregistered event types, etc.</p>
</div>
<div><h2>CEP in an Akka Event Bus</h2>
An alternative way to incorporate esper in an actor system is by using it as a message classifier in an Eventbus. This is implemented in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/experiments/esperakka/EsperClassification.scala" class="shortcut">EsperClassification</a> trait, which extends
    the standard akka eventbus LookupClassification trait. This trait defines an abstract type EsperEvents that must be defined in a concrete
    implementation of an event bus using this EsperClassification trait.
    <p>To make things a bit more interesting, it makes use of the <b>Union</b> type
    from the <a href="http://maven-repository.com/artifact/com.gensler/scalavro-util_2.10/0.6.2">scalavro</a> library,
    which in turn is based on <a href="http://www.chuusai.com/2011/06/09/scala-union-types-curry-howard/">this amazing type sorcery</a>...</p>
    This allows us to define multiple event types as acceptable to be posted on the bus. This is type checked at compile time, and
    they could be any combination of primitives, case classes, collections, etc. Any calls to broadcast with type outside the Union will result in a compile
    time error; for example, calling <code>EsperModuleEventBus.broadcast("Hello there!")</code> in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/experiments/esperakka/EsperEventBusExample.scala" class="shortcut">EsperEventBusExample</a> will result in:
    <pre><code>
        Cannot prove that com.gensler.scalavro.util.Union.not[com.gensler.scalavro.util.Union.not[String]] &lt;:&lt; experiments.esperakka.EsperModuleEventBus.EsperEvents.
        EsperModuleEventBus.broadcast("Hello there!")
        ^
    </code></pre>
    All events put on the bus using <code>broadcast</code> are inserted into the esper engine and the bus - which
    has registered itself as the update listener with the EPL statements - will publish all the <b>EsperEvent</b>s coming out of the esper engine
    with the event type as the topic. It does so using the mechanisms of its parent LookupClassification trait, so any actor that has
    subscribed to the event type will receive these events. The examples show how to subscribe. There are two example bus implementations defined
    in the example. One example uses the <code>epl</code> method to install individual EPL statements, the other mixes in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/experiments/esperakka/ExampleEsperModule.scala" class="shortcut">ExampleEsperModule</a>
    trait to deploy an entire esper module into the bus. Defining a bus this way is so compact it can be shown right here:
    <pre><code>
    object EsperModuleEventBus extends ActorEventBus with EsperClassification with ExampleEsperModule {
      type EsperEvents = union[Price] #or [Sell] #or [Buy]
      override def esperEventTypes = new Union[EsperEvents]
    }
    </code></pre>
    The <code>override def esperEventTypes = new Union[EsperEvents]</code> will
    always be exactly same, but unfortunately we can't pull it up because of a technicality of TypeTags...
